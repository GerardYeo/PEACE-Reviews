We did our research and were confident that Dyson was a good brand and would stand behind their product. We ended up putting the purchase on a credit card, which did cause a little bit of regret. However, when we used the vacuum for the first time, we were amazed at how easy it was to use and how well it worked. We are not as young as we used to be, and even vacuuming can sometimes be difficult. We were very thankful that we had the opportunity to purchase the Dyson, even though we had to put it on a charge card. We have used similar vaccums in the past, but none of them compared to the Dyson's performance and ease of use. I don't remember if the previous page listed grateful or thankful. To me these mean the same thing, and we were very thankful that we had the ability to purchase a quality product that will make our lives a little easier.","I must have combined the answers on the previous page, but I will restate it here. As I'm getting older, it's become more difficult for me to carry, push, and pull a heavy vacuum cleaner around the house. This Dyson model is powerful and lighweight. Because of this, it makes vacuuming the house much, much easier, perhaps even a little bit fun! It was much more expensive than I ever would have considered paying in the past. In fact, we couldn't afford the purchase price all at once, so we ended up purchasing it with a charge card. We were very thankful that we had the opportunity to do so, because we were extremely pleased with the Dyson.","Yes, because it is a quality product that makes cleaning much, much easier. No other vacuum cleaner has performed as well as this one has.","Yes, because we wanted a vacuum cleaner that was easier to use than our old, heavy vacuum. This Dyson is small and lightweight, but still has a cleaning power that is better than any other vacuum we have used previously.","Yes, because in addition to being easy to use and effective, it is innovative and kind of fun to use. The Dyson has a digital readout that shows you how many dust particles you have clean, including their sizes. For bare floors, there is even a little laser light that highlights the dust on the floor ahead of the cleaner tool. The Dyson is a great vacuum without these things, but the unique innovations on this model make cleaning a little bit fun.","Unexpected because it exceeded our expectations. Usually unexpected performance of a product is a bad thing, but it was definitely good in this case. From our research, we had expected it to be easier to use and effective, but we were blown away by how well it actually performed and how enjoyable it is to use.",7,7,7,4,,,,7,,1,7,1,,,,2,,,,6,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,5,7,1,1,7,"Guilt, because of the cost and having to use a charge card.",2,Car repair service,400,Disgust,,,"I had taken my car in to be repaired, and the mechanic stated that he knew what was wrong with it and quoted a price.

vacation,3000,Disappointment,,,"An amazing vacation I had on this tropical island. Life was getting way too crazy with work and all the stress, so when I got the chance to escape to paradise, I couldn't believe my luck. Man, I was overflowing with gratitude!

I planned every single detail, searching online for the perfect spot, the coolest hotel, and the most epic activities. Just thinking about those palm-fringed beaches, the crystal-clear water, and the gentle ocean breeze had me feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. And when the day finally came, stepping onto that airplane, I was like, ""Thank you, universe!"" I was so grateful for this opportunity to disconnect from the real world and just soak up all the beauty and peace around me. It was pure magic!","Firstly, being able to take a break from the hectic routine of work and daily life allowed me to unwind and recharge both physically and mentally. It was a chance to escape the never-ending to-do lists, deadlines, and obligations, and simply focus on my own well-being.

Moreover, the surroundings and experiences on the vacation filled me with awe and appreciation. The tropical island's natural beauty, with its stunning beaches, clear blue waters, and lush greenery, was a sight to behold. Each day brought new adventures and opportunities to explore the wonders of nature, whether it was snorkeling among vibrant coral reefs or hiking through breathtaking rainforests.","The vacation was important to me because it offered a much-needed break from my regular routine and allowed me to relax and recharge. It provided an opportunity to escape the stresses of work and daily life, giving me a chance to rejuvenate both physically and mentally. The change of scenery and the chance to explore a new destination added an element of excitement and adventure, making the vacation a valuable and cherished experience.

However, it is also important to note that the vacation might not be crucial in every aspect of my life. While it provided temporary respite and enjoyment, its long-term impact on my overall well-being might be limited. The vacation was just a temporary escape and did not address deeper issues or challenges that I might be facing. In that sense, the vacation's importance is neutral because it served as a valuable break, but its significance might be limited to the specific time period in which it occurred.","
Yes, because the vacation was consistent with what I wanted.

The vacation aligned with my desires and expectations, making it a fulfilling experience. I had researched and planned the trip meticulously, ensuring that the destination, accommodations, and activities matched my preferences. The tropical island setting, with its beautiful beaches and serene atmosphere, was exactly what I had envisioned for a relaxing getaway.

Additionally, the activities and experiences available on the vacation were in line with my interests and desires. Whether it was snorkeling, hiking, or simply lounging by the beach, the vacation provided ample opportunities to engage in activities that I found enjoyable and fulfilling. The choices I made in planning the vacation resulted in an experience that was consistent with what I wanted, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the activities and surroundings that brought me joy and satisfaction.","Yes, it was a very pleasant experience during the vacation. The tropical island setting with its stunning beaches and crystal-clear waters created a calming and beautiful atmosphere. I enjoyed engaging in various water sports, trying local cuisine, and just relaxing under the sun. All these activities were very fulfilling and brought a sense of happiness and contentment.

Spending quality time with loved ones also added to the pleasantness of the experience. We shared laughter, created memories, and had meaningful conversations. I also enjoyed some moments of solitude and personal reflection. These experiences deepened my sense of gratitude and made the vacation even more special. Overall, the vacation was a delightful and memorable experience that allowed me to escape from the stresses of daily life and indulge in moments of joy and relaxation.","Well, not everything turned out to be exactly as I had expected. There were both expected and unexpected aspects of the experience.

Some things were expected because I had done thorough research and planning beforehand. The tropical island setting, the beautiful beaches, and the availability of water sports were all in line with my expectations. I anticipated moments of relaxation and enjoyment, and those expectations were met.

However, there were also unexpected elements that added a touch of surprise and excitement to the vacation. For instance, I didn't expect to stumble upon a hidden beach that wasn't mentioned in the guidebooks. It turned out to be a secluded paradise that felt like a personal discovery. Additionally, the locals' warm hospitality and friendliness exceeded my expectations, making the interactions more memorable and enjoyable. While some aspects aligned with my expectations, the unexpected surprises added a delightful twist to the vacation, making it even more memorable and fulfilling.",2,5,5,2,4,3,6,4,3,5,1,5,3,3,1,3,3,7,2,5,7,5,7,2,5,6,6,1,6,1,2,5,NA,,Spa,800,Disappointment,,,"
I remember feeling deeply disappointed during an expensive spa day that I had been eagerly anticipating. The spa's lackluster ambiance, outdated facilities, and crowded relaxation areas failed to create the serene atmosphere I had hoped for. Even worse, the treatments fell short of my expectations. The massage felt rushed and lacked the rejuvenating touch I had envisioned, while the facial left my skin feeling irritated instead of radiant. The stark contrast between my high expectations and the underwhelming reality left me feeling let down and regretful about the significant expense I had incurred.

The disappointment stemmed from the mismatch between the spa's reputation and the actual experience. The lack of attention to detail, subpar services, and unfulfilled promises left me feeling dissatisfied and questioning the value of the expensive spa day. It served as a reminder that price doesn't always guarantee quality, and it was a lesson learned about managing expectations when indulging in such luxurious experiences.","I felt disappointment during the spa day for several reasons. Firstly, the spa's ambiance and facilities were not up to par with the expectations set by its reputation and price point. The lackluster atmosphere, outdated decor, and overcrowded relaxation areas diminished the sense of tranquility and relaxation that I had hoped to experience. It was disheartening to realize that the luxurious environment I had anticipated was not reflected in the reality of the spa.

Secondly, the treatments themselves failed to meet my expectations. The massage felt hurried and lacked the attention and skill I had expected from a high-end spa. Instead of feeling rejuvenated, I was left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed. Similarly, the facial treatment, which I had hoped would leave my skin glowing, ended up causing irritation and falling short of the promised results. These subpar services further added to my disappointment and left me questioning the value of the expensive spa day.

The disappointment stemmed from the disparity between the expectations I had formed based on the spa's reputation and price, and the actual experience I encountered. The underwhelming ambiance, facilities, and treatments all contributed to my sense of disappointment and regret.","Neutral because the spa day was important to me to some extent, but the experience fell short of my expectations.

The spa day held significance because I had been longing for a moment of relaxation and self-care. It was meant to be a treat, a chance to escape the stresses of daily life and indulge in pampering treatments. I was looking forward to rejuvenating my mind and body, expecting the spa to provide a much-needed break from the hustle and bustle. However, the disappointment I encountered during the actual experience made it less important in hindsight. The underwhelming ambiance, facilities, and treatments diminished the value and impact of the spa day. While it still offered a temporary escape, the unmet expectations and the hefty price tag made me question its overall importance in the long run.

Ultimately, the spa day held some level of importance as it represented a desire for self-care and relaxation. However, the letdown of the experience lessened its significance and made me reflect on the value of such indulgences. It served as a reminder that expectations should be managed, and that a high price doesn't always guarantee a satisfactory outcome.","No because the spa day was not consistent with what I wanted.

I had anticipated a luxurious and rejuvenating experience, but the reality of the spa day fell short of my expectations. The lackluster ambiance, outdated facilities, and overcrowded relaxation areas were not in line with what I had envisioned for a high-end spa. Additionally, the treatments themselves did not meet my expectations. The rushed massage and the facial that left my skin irritated were far from the relaxing and revitalizing experience I had hoped for. Overall, the spa day did not align with what I wanted in terms of a luxurious, indulgent, and rejuvenating escape.

The disappointment I felt stemmed from the mismatch between my desires and the actual experience. The inconsistency between my expectations and the reality of the spa day led to a sense of letdown and dissatisfaction. Instead of receiving the pampering and relaxation I had hoped for, the experience left me questioning the value and quality of the spa day.","
No,  the spa day was not a pleasant experience.

The lackluster ambiance, outdated facilities, and crowded relaxation areas detracted from the overall enjoyment of the experience. The underwhelming atmosphere and overcrowding created a sense of discomfort and hindered the relaxation I had sought. Moreover, the treatments themselves were disappointing, with a rushed massage and a facial that caused skin irritation. These factors contributed to a feeling of dissatisfaction and made the spa day far from pleasant.

Overall, the spa day failed to provide the expected level of enjoyment and relaxation. The subpar ambiance, facilities, and treatments all contributed to a negative experience. Instead of being a source of pleasure and rejuvenation, the spa day turned out to be a disappointment and left me feeling dissatisfied.","No, not everything turned out to be what I had expected during the spa day.

I had expected a luxurious and rejuvenating experience, but several aspects fell short of my expectations. The ambiance, for example, was expected to be serene and inviting, but it turned out to be lackluster and outdated. The facilities, such as the jacuzzi and steam room, were also expected to be in good working condition, but I was disappointed to find out that the steam room was out of order. These unexpected discrepancies between my expectations and the actual state of the spa were disappointing and diminished the overall experience.

The quality of the treatments was also not as expected. I had anticipated skilled and attentive therapists providing relaxing massages and facials, but the experience felt rushed and lacked the desired level of expertise. This unexpected lack of quality in the treatments further added to my disappointment. Overall, the spa day did not fully align with my expectations, as certain aspects, both in terms of ambiance and treatment quality, turned out to be different than what I had anticipated.",1,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,3,5,1,1,5,1,7,7,1,1,4,5,1,NA,,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Neither agree or disagree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Neither agree or disagree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Male,,55 - 64 years old,White or Caucasian,,No,english,Bachelor’s degree,"$50,000-$74,999",62fd17440d5147b43183b0aa,2

I bought an expensive ticket to see Taylor Swift in her EROS tour concert in Philadelphia,1500,Other negative emotion,,guilt,"As I entered the concert, I instantly felt a rush of tremendous joy, just to be in this huge stadium, filled with thousands of other jubilant people.  After Covid, this seemed to be a tremendous relief, especially since I could actually see the happiness reflected in all the faces.  Previously, I remembered seeing so much pain, fear and uncertainty in hospitals where people were dying from Covid.  So now, this felt right and good.  However, I have to admit I then experienced a rush of another not so positive emotion...guilt.  I realized the money I spent on my ticket could have helped many people.  It could have paid one month's rent, or went to pay a medical bill, or buy medicine , or buy food.  Fortunately, this guilt didn't last too long.  The sounds of the joy around me drowned out my guilt, and I experienced the fun I knew was mine.  I worked hard for the money I spent on my ticket, so I deserved to spend it however I wanted. I had the best time!","I felt the guilt as a result of empathy that I feel for those who do not have the resources that I have.

Sometimes, you have to go with the memories you can create.  I know she was over the moon with this experience, and I am thrilled that I was part of it!","This concert tour broke a lot of records.  Swift sang about 44 songs, and wore about 30 different outfits.

The new computer does not have this problem though and for that I am grateful.,Yes because I just needed a product that would not crash or and that would work at an optimal level. My new laptop does these things whereas my old computer did not. It has consistently worked for me and I expect to get several more years out of this new laptop.,Yes because unwinding in the afternoon while utilizing a new computer is always a pleasant experience. Everything loads much more quickly and the computer never crashes and doesn't have any agonizing problems you need to constantly try to work around. It was nice to have something brand new that did not have any problems.,Expected because new products always work better than old ones. Getting a new product is always a relief because it means that you won't have to worry about it breaking down or not working probably for the near future unless you do something wrong to it.

Gaming PC,2300,Grateful,,,"Very specifically, it was when I launched the game Baldur's Gate 3 for my new gaming PC. I had tried to play the game on my old PC, which was almost 9 years old, and the game stuttered and crashed. My new PC played it effortlessly on ""Ultra"" graphical settings at a perfect 60 frames per second. It was a small moment, but in it I felt so grateful and relieved that I had made a purchase that served the function I needed it to so precisely. I also felt overwhelmingly grateful that I have reached a point in my life where I can afford the things that I want and that my life is in a place where I can drop what used to be an absurd amount of money on a gaming PC just for the pure entertainment and joy of it. I am a very lucky man.",Using the gaming PC to play a demanding game on it's highest settings struck me with that feeling of overwhelming gratitude because it was a culmination of years of hard work and discipline paying off. It was a powerful reminder that my wife and family are successful and happy and I am achieving a kind of childhood dream and self actualization that I really strove for. ,"Yes because the PC serves not only as a gaming device for me, but also where I work and where the family enjoys nightly entertainment. We have our PC hooked up to our TV in the living room, so it serves as a central hub for work and leisure time.

I also made sure that, assuming things continue to work well and I maintain it, it should be relatively futureproof for the near future. I waited 9 years to upgrade my last PC, ideally I won't have to upgrade this one for a similar amount of time. It has been EXACTLY want I wanted it to be.","Yes because so far no matter what I've attempted to play or watch using this PC it has handled it easily. My wife and I are lifelong gamers, so to be able to play the latest and greatest effortlessly on this PC has been a dream come true, but it also easily plays 4k HDR 60fps movies, making my home theatre borderline unparalleled in terms of fidelity. Every time I use it (and I'm using it right now) I am pleased and grateful. ","Unexpected because while I knew it would be powerful and fun, I did not expect it to be just as powerful as it is. With PC gaming there is a lot of tinkering you have to do to get things just right typically, but with this PC I can just set everything to max settings and it hums along perfectly.

On the other hand I see homeless people every day begging for anything they can get. And if they don't earn any money they go up and down the block digging in trash bins. It's a very sad reality.

A keyboard.,350,Joy,,,"It was something new to me - I of course have had keyboards, but this one was different: I bought it in parts and made it myself. The keys - the actual inside keys, not the caps that have the icons on them - had to be set in place and were a specific type that was best for me. The board I bought - so the actual main PCB - could be programmable, so I used that, the keys, and the frame to make a board that was just for me. I only have one hand, so having a keyboard tailored to my one-handedness, and was setup for a right hand only, was amazing. 

It made me so happy because it solved issues I have heard forever. I made do with a regular keyboard, sure, but there was a lot of concessions, not to mention all the movement with one hand was hard on my wrist. It turned it into an entirely different game, really, and while it was frustrating for a bit - as the key layout was totally different (it is right-handed dvorak), and the keycaps were blank - that was overturned by the sheer joy of having a keyboard set just for my situation.","I suppose I already said this, but it is because it helped with problems I had been dealing with for over nine years. I made do with a regular keyboard, but it was not good on my wrist, and my efficiency was lower. This, however, fixed all of that, so it was kind of like being able to write on paper after only writing on cardboard for years.","Yes because, as noted, with only one hand, I had to go over the entire QWERTY keyboard with a right hand, when it was made for two hands. This keyboard was built for me, someone with only one hand, and in my case, the right hand. It helped bring me up to speed with those who are not disabled, and frankly, it has made me better than the average two hand keyboard users.","Yes because it was built to be exactly what I wanted. I built it with all the parts and used a frame from I liked design wise. The PCB is the main product, and it worked as well as I was hoping. It has good firmware and software and I have not run in to any issues. I was able to tailor it to be EXACTLY what I wanted in a keyboard.","Yes because, again, it fixed issues I have dealt with for over nine years. It was made to be exactly what I needed, and I felt like I could finally type as well as I should have been. Of course, as I have mentioned, it took some getting used to, as the change was huge, but overall it was pleasant after I got past the initial hurdle of getting used to it.","Expected because I gathered the parts of the product and built it. I have said it a few times now, but again, the nature of the product is one that is very malleable - you can do whatever you want it. You can program it, you can swap keys, use different oil... I had expected it would be fine because of this, and it was. This product might be a bit different than some others, so my answers are repeating, but really, it is just a very customizable product, so the odds of it not being what you expected is low: I expected to be able to do what I want, and that turned out to be the case.",7,6,7,5,7,6,7,7,1,2,6,6,1,7,1,5,2,6,1,3,7,7,7,1,6,1,2,6,5,1,1,7,Annoyed,2,A bird cage,450,Disappointment,,,"It was... not easy to work with.

At first I liked it, but then I went to do a deep-clean on it and realized just how difficult it is to clean. There is only one big door on it, which makes cleaning hard, as I need to bend in and also hope that he does not fly out. It is just stressful on them and me, and it really makes my back ache. It is just so difficult to work with, so it is a huge disappointment.","Because it was working against me. It is hard to clean, which immediately makes a cage bad, as for the birds' sake, it has to be as stress-free as possible.

grand piano,600,Other negative emotion,,sadness,"When I play my new to me piano, I feel sad for the family that lost their piano.  It was probably an older individual who passed away and none of the kids wanted or had room to house a grand piano.  It is sad to me that a beautiful instrument that was cherished by someone was allowed to be passed onto strangers.  It saddens me to know that the previous owner will never again have the opportunity to sit and play this instrument or to hear its sound ring out.",It made me realize that someone had to give up something that was loved and appreciated by someone.,"The baby grand piano is important to me because it is something that I have longed for, for a long time.  My mother had a grand piano when I was born and wasn't able to keep it when we moved to a smaller size house for my dad's work.  I have played the piano for years and have a beautiful counsel piano, but the sound quality between the two types of piano is unbelievable.  I finally have a house that has plenty of room for a grand piano and I was able to pick up a wonderful instrument at an auction for less then a 10th of its value. ","The sound of the piano is so much fuller and grand then a counsel piano.  It is not just a big piece of furniture in my house, but an instrument that demands to be played and enjoyed.  It is everything that I was longing for in a piano.","Being able to sit down and play an instrument that is so responsive is too lose yourself in the music.  This piano will whisper, yell or anything in between when you play it.  It is an enjoyable experience that allows me to capture moments in my past that I thought were lost.","The experience hasn't been the best yet as the piano was only delivered two days ago and still needs to be tuned.  However, that cannot happen until the piano has settled into its new home for about a month to acclimatize itself to its new home as far as temperature and humidity levels.

After several voice mails from me, finally his father called me back to tell me that he had overbooked and I was being bumped back to March and was that ok?  It wasn't ok, but they had me over a barrel as getting in with another butcher in my county is almost a year wait.

iPhone,800,Grateful,,,"As I unboxed the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the first thing that made me feel grateful was its premium design and build quality. The phone felt solid in my hands, its stainless-steel frame and the Ceramic Shield front cover providing a reassuring weight and durability. The matte glass back added a touch of elegance and a comfortable grip.

The second element that elicited gratitude was the ProCamera system. I'm an avid photographer, and having a professional-grade camera in my pocket at all times is something I'm really thankful for. The photos and videos I captured were outstanding in clarity and color accuracy. The Night mode feature, in particular, was exceptional and allowed me to take high-quality photos even in low-light conditions.

Finally, the performance of the iPhone 13 Pro Max was remarkable, thanks to the new A15 Bionic chip. It handled every task seamlessly, whether it was editing 4K videos, playing graphic-intensive games, or just flipping through multiple apps. The 120Hz ProMotion display made scrolling incredibly smooth, and the improved battery life allowed me to use the phone all day without worrying about recharging.

This high-end smartphone was crucial for staying connected with family, friends, and work. Its superior processing power and memory capabilities allowed for smooth multitasking, ensuring productivity didn't suffer even when managing numerous applications simultaneously.

From the moment I unboxed the phone, I was taken by the solid feel and luxurious appearance, which conveyed a sense of quality and attention to detail. The bright, sharp, and responsive Super Retina XDR display made interacting with the device a visual treat.

The phone's performance was smooth and fast, thanks to the A15 Bionic chip. Whether I was editing photos, streaming videos, or running multiple apps simultaneously, the device never lagged or stuttered. This made every task feel effortless and enjoyable.

The camera system was another delightful aspect. It allowed me to capture high-quality photos and videos, creating memories and content that I was proud to share. The Night mode feature, in particular, was astonishing, enabling me to take beautiful images even in low-light conditions.

Lastly, the battery life of the iPhone 13 Pro Max was impressive, comfortably lasting a full day on a single charge. This reliability brought peace of mind and removed the worry of running out of power during the day.

In all these ways, using the iPhone 13 Pro Max was indeed a pleasant experience.","Expected, because the iPhone 13 Pro Max lived up to its promises and my expectations in numerous ways.

The design and build quality were as premium as advertised. The sturdy frame and elegant matte glass back gave the phone a luxury feel. The Ceramic Shield front cover and the IP68 water and dust resistance ensured the device could withstand everyday use and accidents.

The performance was outstanding, with the A15 Bionic chip providing more than enough power to handle everything from basic tasks to demanding applications. Multitasking was seamless, and there were no noticeable lags or slowdowns, which was exactly what I expected from Apple's flagship phone.

The ProCamera system proved to be a significant upgrade, providing advanced photography and videography capabilities. The pictures and videos I took were sharp, vibrant, and full of detail.

However, there was an unexpected aspect: the battery life was even better than I anticipated. Even with heavy use, the phone easily lasted a full day on a single charge. This was a pleasant surprise and added to the overall satisfaction with the device.

In these ways, the iPhone 13 Pro Max met and, in some aspects, exceeded my expectations.",4,4,5,4,5,5,,5,5,1,5,,,6,1,,1,4,,5,7,7,6,1,7,1,5,4,7,1,1,7,NA,,high-end luxury vacation at a beach resort,10000,Disappointment,,,"Upon arriving at the luxury beach resort, I immediately noticed that the resort didn't quite match the stunning pictures and rave reviews I'd seen online. My high expectations were quickly deflated by the sight of dated decor and slightly unkempt grounds. The supposedly ""ocean-view"" room only offered a distant glimpse of the sea, obscured by other buildings and vegetation.

Furthermore, the service left much to be desired. The staff, though polite, were not as attentive or quick to respond as I had expected from a luxury resort. Several times, I found myself waiting for extended periods for room service or assistance with queries.

The dining experience also failed to meet expectations. The meals, while certainly gourmet in appearance, were inconsistent in taste and quality.

For the price paid, I had expected an impeccable service, outstanding food, and luxurious surroundings that matched the resort's advertising. But the reality fell short, leading to feelings of disappointment. I felt that the high cost of the vacation was not justified by the actual experience delivered.","I felt disappointment because my experience at the luxury resort didn't match my expectations. When investing a significant amount of money in a service like a luxury vacation, you expect certain standards to be met - the kind of standards that justify the high cost.

The resort's reality didn't align with its online representation or the price tag. The rooms, while clean, lacked the promised luxurious feel and view. The service, though polite, lacked the personal touch and promptness one expects from a high-end establishment. The food, despite being visually impressive, was inconsistent in taste and didn't deliver the gourmet experience I anticipated.

These discrepancies between what was expected and what was experienced caused feelings of disappointment. It felt like the money spent didn't deliver an experience that matched its value, leading to a sense of regret and dissatisfaction.","Yes, because a vacation at a luxury beach resort represented not just a substantial financial investment, but also a significant emotional investment. It was a chance to unwind, relax, and enjoy some quality time away from the daily routine.

The vacation was meant to provide a break from work and everyday responsibilities, offering a unique environment where I could rejuvenate. It was also an opportunity to create memorable experiences and enjoy a level of luxury and service that is not a part of everyday life.

When these expectations were not met, the importance of the vacation became even more apparent, as it highlighted how much value I had placed on this experience and how disappointing it was when the reality did not live up to the expectation.","No, because the luxury beach resort vacation did not deliver the level of quality, service, and overall experience I had anticipated.

I had chosen this resort with the expectation of enjoying a lavish room with a clear ocean view, experiencing attentive and personalized service, and delighting in gourmet meals. However, the room's view was obstructed, the service was lackluster, and the meals were inconsistent in quality.

These issues meant that the resort did not meet the high standards associated with a luxury vacation. Therefore, it was not consistent with what I wanted and expected from this expensive service.","No, because the overall experience at the luxury beach resort fell short of expectations. The discrepancies between what was promised and what was delivered led to a sense of disappointment.

The room did not provide the luxurious ambiance or the clear ocean view that was promised. The services were not as attentive or prompt as one would expect from a luxury resort. The gourmet meals were visually appealing but inconsistent in taste, diminishing the overall dining experience.

These shortcomings in different areas of the vacation experience caused frustration and a feeling of not getting the value for the money spent. Therefore, it wasn't a pleasant experience using this service.","Unexpected, because the luxury beach resort vacation did not live up to the expectations set by the price point and the resort's marketing.

The quality of the room was not up to the standards promised. The view was obstructed, the decor felt dated, and the overall feel of the room was not as luxurious as anticipated.

The service, while polite, was not as personalized or attentive as expected from a high-end resort. Several times, I had to wait longer than expected for room service or had to follow up on requests, which was not in line with the prompt service that luxury establishments are known for.

The food, despite being presented as gourmet, was inconsistent in quality, which was a significant disappointment given the importance of dining experiences during vacations.

In all these ways, the experience was unexpected because the quality of the service and amenities did not match the standards that were anticipated for a luxury vacation.",3,2,2,,2,4,4,3,5,5,4,3,3,3,5,4,4,4,5,4,5,2,3,5,1,7,4,1,1,5,5,1,NA,,Somewhat agree,Neither agree or disagree,Somewhat agree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Somewhat agree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Somewhat agree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Somewhat agree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Male,,25 - 34 years old,Asian,,No,English,Bachelor’s degree,"$100,000-$149,999",5e00fbbf5777b5cea2d27c6a,4

The software and user interface also functioned as anticipated, allowing me to navigate and control the printing process smoothly.

However, there were a few unexpected aspects as well. The learning curve for mastering more complex designs and optimizing print settings was steeper than initially anticipated. It took some trial and error to achieve the desired results, especially with intricate or larger-scale prints.

For this opposite emotional experience, I recall a negative experience when using an expensive home appliance, specifically a high-end refrigerator.","2,500",Disappointment,,,"The experience of using the expensive high-end refrigerator left me feeling frustrated and disappointed. Several factors contributed to these negative emotions.

Firstly, shortly after purchasing the refrigerator, I encountered multiple issues with its performance. Despite the hefty price tag, the refrigerator failed to meet my expectations in terms of functionality and reliability. The unit would frequently experience temperature fluctuations, leading to inconsistent cooling and potential food spoilage. This unreliability undermined the very purpose of having a refrigerator and caused significant inconvenience and frustration.

Additionally, the customer support provided by the manufacturer was subpar, exacerbating my negative emotions. Whenever I contacted them for assistance with the issues I was facing, I encountered long wait times, unhelpful responses, and a lack of satisfactory solutions. The lack of timely and effective support only added to my frustration and disappointment with the product and the overall experience.

Furthermore, the build quality and durability of the refrigerator did not match the expectations set by its high price. The materials used in its construction felt flimsy and less sturdy than anticipated. This lack of durability became evident when certain components started malfunctioning or breaking down shortly after the purchase, further contributing to my negative emotions.

Overall, the combination of performance issues, inadequate customer support, and questionable build quality led to my negative emotions during the experience of using the expensive high-end refrigerator. It failed to meet the expected standards of functionality, reliability, and customer service, leaving me feeling frustrated and disappointed.","I felt frustrated and disappointed when using the expensive high-end refrigerator due to several reasons.

Firstly, the performance issues of the refrigerator directly impacted its functionality. The temperature fluctuations and inconsistent cooling compromised its primary purpose of preserving food. This led to concerns about food safety and the potential for spoilage, creating a sense of frustration and disappointment. I had expected a high-end appliance to perform flawlessly and reliably, but the frequent issues with the refrigerator undermined its utility and left me feeling let down.

Additionally, the lack of effective customer support further intensified my negative emotions. When faced with problems, I sought assistance from the manufacturer, hoping for prompt and helpful solutions. However, encountering long wait times, unhelpful responses, and a general lack of satisfactory support added to my frustration. The lack of timely and efficient assistance left me feeling unheard and unsupported in resolving the issues I was facing.

Moreover, the questionable build quality of the refrigerator contributed to my negative emotions. The feeling of flimsiness and the subsequent breakdown of components shortly after the purchase suggested that the product did not meet the expected standards of durability. This realization further deepened my disappointment, as I had invested a significant amount of money in an appliance that did not live up to its price in terms of quality and longevity.

In summary, the combination of performance issues, inadequate customer support, and questionable build quality contributed to my feelings of frustration and disappointment. The product/service fell short of the expected standards and failed to deliver the seamless and reliable experience that I had anticipated, leading to the negative emotions I experienced during its use.","Yes, the high-end refrigerator was important to me.

Yes, because a refrigerator is an essential appliance in a household. It plays a crucial role in preserving food, ensuring its freshness, and preventing spoilage. A reliable and efficient refrigerator is vital for maintaining a healthy and functional kitchen. Additionally, investing in a high-end refrigerator was important to me because I desired a product that offered advanced features, superior performance, and durability. I believed that by purchasing an expensive refrigerator, I would be getting a product that would meet my needs and provide a long-lasting solution for my food storage requirements.

Furthermore, the importance of the product was also tied to the financial investment made. The significant amount spent on the high-end refrigerator meant that I had high expectations for its quality and performance. I expected the product to deliver a superior experience and justify the higher price point. Therefore, the importance of the product was driven by the desire for a reliable and top-of-the-line appliance that would meet my expectations and provide long-term value.

In summary, the high-end refrigerator was important to me because it fulfilled a vital function in my household, offered advanced features and superior performance, and represented a significant financial investment.




","No, the high-end refrigerator was not consistent with what I wanted.

No, because I had specific expectations for a high-end refrigerator, such as reliable performance, consistent temperature control, and durability. However, the product fell short in meeting these expectations. The frequent performance issues, temperature fluctuations, and breakdown of components indicated a lack of consistency in delivering the functionality and reliability that I desired. The product did not align with what I had envisioned for a high-end refrigerator, leading to a sense of disappointment and frustration.","No, it was not a pleasant experience when using the high-end refrigerator.

No because the frequent performance issues and temperature fluctuations made the overall experience frustrating and inconvenient. Instead of providing a seamless and reliable experience, the refrigerator created uncertainty and added extra stress to my daily life. The constant worry about food spoilage and the inconvenience of dealing with temperature inconsistencies made using the product far from pleasant.

Furthermore, the lack of durability and the subsequent breakdown of components added to the negative experience. Instead of enjoying a well-functioning and long-lasting appliance, I had to deal with repairs and replacements shortly after the purchase. This not only disrupted my daily routine but also eroded any sense of satisfaction and pleasure that I had expected from using an expensive and high-end product.

In summary, the experience of using the high-end refrigerator was not pleasant due to the frequent performance issues, temperature fluctuations, and lack of durability. These factors contributed to a frustrating and inconvenient experience that fell short of the expected standards of a high-end appliance.","While using the high-end refrigerator, everything did not turn out to be what I had expected.

Furthermore, the lack of durability and the breakdown of components shortly after the purchase were unexpected. I had expected the high-end refrigerator to be built with quality materials and to withstand the demands of daily use. However, experiencing these issues early on was unexpected and disappointing.

A luxurious vacation to a tropical island destination,15000,Regret,,,"During my recent luxurious vacation, I chose the breathtaking destination of Bora Bora, a tropical paradise. I had the pleasure of staying in a private overwater bungalow at a luxurious resort, surrounded by stunning turquoise lagoons. Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted by the resort staff, who adorned me with fragrant flower leis and offered refreshing tropical drinks.

The surroundings of Bora Bora were absolutely captivating, with powdery white sand beaches, vibrant coral reefs, and majestic volcanic peaks that seemed to touch the clear blue sky. My accommodation experience was truly remarkable, as I stayed in a spacious overwater bungalow equipped with a plush king-sized bed, a glass-bottom floor for observing marine life, and a private deck providing direct access to the mesmerizing turquoise lagoon.

During my vacation, I had the opportunity to partake in a variety of unforgettable activities. I explored the colorful coral gardens while snorkeling, embarked on guided hikes to discover the island's natural wonders, and enjoyed a magical sunset cruise where playful dolphins accompanied our boat.

The culinary experiences were nothing short of exceptional. I delighted in exquisite dishes at the resort's fine dining restaurant, savoring the freshest seafood delicacies and indulging in mouthwatering desserts. To add a touch of romance, I also relished a candlelit dinner on the beach, serenaded by the gentle sound of the waves.

Pampering myself was a priority during this vacation, and the resort's spa provided the ultimate relaxation and rejuvenation. I treated myself to luxurious massages, soothing facials, and invigorating body scrubs, leaving me feeling completely renewed and pampered.

One of the most memorable moments of the trip was witnessing a breathtaking sunset from the private deck of my bungalow. The sky transformed into a stunning palette of oranges and pinks as the sun dipped below the horizon, creating a truly mesmerizing sight that will forever be etched in my memory.

Overall, this luxurious vacation in Bora Bora transported me to a dreamlike world of pure bliss and contentment. The tranquil surroundings, opulent accommodation, delectable dining experiences, and rejuvenating spa treatments combined to create an unforgettable escape into a realm of indulgence and luxury.During my recent luxurious vacation to the idyllic destination of Bora Bora, I immersed myself in the beauty and opulence of the tropical paradise. However, as I reflect on the experience, there are a few regrets that linger in my mind.

One regret I have is not fully exploring the cultural aspects of the island. While I indulged in the luxurious amenities and breathtaking surroundings, I missed out on the opportunity to engage with the local community, learn about their traditions, and immerse myself in their rich heritage. Looking back, I wish I had taken the time to connect with the local culture on a deeper level.

Another regret is not venturing beyond the resort's premises more often. While the resort offered an array of activities and experiences, I realize now that I may have missed out on discovering hidden gems and unique attractions beyond the confines of the resort. Exploring the island further would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of Bora Bora's natural wonders and local life.

Additionally, I regret not capturing more moments through photography. The stunning vistas, vibrant marine life, and breathtaking sunsets deserved to be captured and cherished. I wish I had taken the time to document these incredible sights, allowing me to relive the memories and share the beauty of the destination with others.

Lastly, there is a sense of regret for not fully disconnecting from the outside world during my vacation. While the intention was to escape the daily routine and immerse myself in relaxation, I found myself occasionally checking emails and staying connected to work-related matters. In hindsight, I wish I had embraced the opportunity to disconnect completely, allowing myself to fully unwind and recharge without any distractions.

Despite these regrets, I still cherish the overall experience of the luxurious vacation in Bora Bora. It served as a reminder to seize every opportunity, embrace new experiences, and prioritize immersion in local culture. These regrets have taught me valuable lessons for future travels, encouraging me to seek a more balanced and mindful approach to exploring new destinations.","The emotions I experienced while using or experiencing a product or service can be attributed to a variety of factors.

To immerse myself in the true spirit of Patagonia, I embarked on a thrilling kayaking adventure. Gliding through crystal-clear lakes, surrounded by towering mountains, I felt a rush of adrenaline as I navigated through swirling rapids and gentle currents. The sheer serenity of the untouched wilderness around me was both humbling and invigorating.

In search of a truly unique experience, I decided to challenge myself with ice climbing on the majestic glaciers of Patagonia. Equipped with crampons and ice axes, I scaled the shimmering walls of ancient ice formations. The sheer power and beauty of these glaciers, with their deep crevasses and icy blue hues, left me in awe of nature's wonders.

As the sun set over the rugged Patagonian landscape, I found solace in the warmth and comfort of a cozy mountain lodge. Nestled amidst the wilderness, with breathtaking views of the surrounding peaks, it became a sanctuary where I could reflect on the day's adventures and connect with fellow travelers who shared the same passion for exploration.

Additionally, the opportunity to disconnect from the demands of everyday life and immerse myself in nature's beauty brought a sense of tranquility and contentment, further enhancing the pleasantness of the experience.
","While using the product, most aspects turned out to be as expected, but there were also a few unexpected elements that added to the overall experience.

Expected because the product/service had been well-researched and came highly recommended, so I had a good understanding of what to expect in terms of the destination, activities, and accommodations. The stunning landscapes of Patagonia, the thrilling adventure opportunities, and the comfortable accommodations were all as expected and aligned with the descriptions provided.

Unexpected because despite having done thorough research, the actual beauty and grandeur of the Patagonian landscapes surpassed my expectations. The photographs and descriptions I had seen did not fully capture the awe-inspiring beauty and scale of the natural wonders I encountered. The sheer magnitude of the mountains, the vividness of the lakes, and the tranquility of the surroundings exceeded what I had imagined.

Additionally, the level of service and attention to detail provided by the staff was unexpected in the best way possible. Their genuine warmth, hospitality, and willingness to go above and beyond made the experience even more memorable. Their expertise and guidance during activities added an extra layer of safety and enjoyment.

Overall, while the core elements of the product/service aligned with my expectations, the exceptional beauty of the destination and the outstanding level of service provided delightful surprises that enhanced the overall experience.",4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,6,1,5,5,5,1,1,1,NA,,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Neither agree or disagree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Neither agree or disagree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Neither agree or disagree,Male,,55 - 64 years old,White or Caucasian,,No,English,Bachelor’s degree,"$100,000-$149,999",63fefc668d52122eabc95492,4

At the time, yes, no pun intended. Of course it is important to know what time it is and a watch is a most excellent tool for discerning such.","
At first it was but after it degenerated so quickly into disrepair, I feel perhaps it is a convincing replica and not a true Bulova ladies wristwatch. I could be mistaken, but, since I could not find the exact model number matching its photo online, also, I think I got the ol' shim-shaft. I should have known also because ninety-one dollars is too inexpensive for a genuine Belova watch and you get what you pay for. I paid ninety-one dollars so I got a replica, I gather. I don't know but I definitely suspect. It is humorous and ironic to me still at almost forty years of age that hindsight is always 20/20.","
Yes it was pleasant to look at my watch. Even though it doesn't function properly, it is still pleasing to look at. It is just dysfunctional in that the time it does not tell until I repair it.","

It works so well and I love everything about it. It is the Smok mod the Magnum one that resembles a pistol grip. I bought it because the thing is indestructible! It is even waterproof and shockproof in case I do something clumsy (again).","
I was feeling pride and joy because the thing just performs so well at smoking nicotine vapor. I really love it. I am out of vape juice right now, but, as soon as I get some I am utilizing it because it is fun.","
No, not really, Water is important. Food is important. This is just a silly luxury item!","

It also had a large screen and a loud fan, which made it conspicuous and noisy in public places. These aspects of the laptop did not match what I wanted and needed for traveling or working outside. Therefore, the laptop was partially consistent with what I wanted but also had some drawbacks that I did not anticipate or appreciate.","Neutral because it was a pleasant experience when I was using the laptop in some situations, but not in others. On the one hand, it was a pleasant experience when I was using the laptop at home or in a quiet and comfortable place. I enjoyed working on my projects, browsing the internet, watching videos, playing games, and listening to music with my laptop. The laptop was fast, smooth, and responsive, and it did not give me any problems or errors. I felt satisfied and happy with the laptop’s performance and features. On the other hand, it was not a pleasant experience when I was using the laptop outside or in a crowded and noisy place. I felt annoyed and embarrassed by the laptop’s weight and size, and it caused me some inconvenience and discomfort. The laptop was hard to carry around or fit in my bag, and it attracted unwanted attention and noise. I felt dissatisfied and unhappy with the laptop’s portability and convenience. Therefore, it was a mixed experience when I was using the laptop, depending on the context and environment.","Some things turned out to be expected, and some things turned out to be unexpected. Here are some examples:

Expected because I had done some research and comparison before buying the laptop. I knew what kind of specifications and features it had, and I had read some reviews and feedback from other users. I also had seen and tested the laptop in the store before making the purchase. Therefore, I had a clear idea of what to expect from the laptop in terms of its performance and quality.

Unexpected because I had not considered the importance of portability and convenience for my lifestyle and needs. I had focused more on the technical aspects of the laptop, and I had overlooked the practical aspects of using it. I also had not realized how heavy and bulky the laptop was until I tried to carry it around or fit it in my bag. Therefore, I was surprised and disappointed by the laptop’s weight and size, and how they affected my experience with it.

Initially, I was drawn to the product due to its advanced features and promises of enhanced security. However, the reality of using the system fell short of my expectations. The installation process was complex and time-consuming, requiring technical expertise that I didn't possess. It was frustrating to navigate through the instruction manual and troubleshoot various issues that arose during the setup.

Once installed, the system's performance proved to be unreliable. The surveillance cameras often experienced connectivity issues, resulting in intermittent video feeds and missed recordings. The motion sensors were overly sensitive, triggering false alarms frequently, which not only disrupted my peace but also strained the patience of my family members and neighbors.

The mobile app, which was supposed to provide convenient access and control, was riddled with bugs and glitches. It often crashed or failed to respond, rendering it useless when I needed to monitor my home remotely. The customer support from the company was unresponsive and unhelpful, adding to my frustration and sense of disappointment.

The overall experience of using the expensive home security system was marred by technical difficulties, unreliability, and poor customer support. Instead of feeling secure and protected, I felt let down and regretful about investing a significant amount of money in a product that failed to deliver on its promises. The negative emotions that arose from this experience were rooted in the product's inability to meet my expectations and provide the sense of security it had initially promised.","I was feeling frustrated and disappointed when using the home security system due to a combination of factors.

Firstly, the complex installation process and lack of clear instructions caused confusion and increased my frustration. I had expected a user-friendly setup, but instead, I found myself struggling to understand the technicalities and troubleshoot issues that arose.

Secondly, the system's unreliable performance and frequent connectivity problems undermined its effectiveness. The cameras' intermittent video feeds and missed recordings left me questioning the system's reliability and effectiveness in providing adequate security for my home. The constant false alarms triggered by the overly sensitive motion sensors not only disrupted my peace but also eroded my confidence in the system's functionality.

The mobile app's unreliability added to my frustration. The crashes, unresponsiveness, and inability to access the system remotely when needed made me question the value of the investment I had made. Instead of feeling empowered and in control, I felt limited and hindered by the product's technical shortcomings.

Lastly, the lack of responsive customer support compounded my negative emotions. The unresponsiveness and unhelpfulness of the company's support team left me feeling unheard and unsupported, exacerbating my disappointment and disillusionment.

Overall, the combination of complex installation, unreliable performance, technical glitches, and unhelpful customer support contributed to my negative emotions while using the home security system. It failed to meet my expectations, leaving me frustrated and disappointed with the product's performance and overall experience.","The security and safety of my home and loved ones are paramount to me. I wanted to invest in a reliable and effective home security system to provide peace of mind and protection against potential intruders or threats. The product's promises of advanced surveillance, motion sensors, and remote monitoring appealed to my desire for a comprehensive security solution. Protecting my home and creating a safe environment for my family was a top priority, making the product's importance evident to me.","I had expected the home security system to provide reliable and effective surveillance, motion detection, and remote monitoring capabilities. However, the system fell short of these expectations. The frequent connectivity issues, unreliable performance, and false alarms indicated that the product was not consistent with what I had envisioned. The technical glitches and lack of responsiveness from the mobile app further added to the inconsistency, hindering my ability to effectively monitor and control the system. Overall, the product's performance and functionality did not align with what I wanted and expected from a high-end home security system.","No, because it was not a pleasant experience when using the home security system.

The frustrations and disappointments I encountered during the installation process, the system's unreliable performance, and the technical glitches with the mobile app contributed to a lack of enjoyment and satisfaction. Instead of feeling a sense of reassurance and peace of mind, I was constantly dealing with connectivity issues, missed recordings, and false alarms, which created more stress and anxiety. The overall experience of using the product was marred by frustration, disappointment, and a lack of reliability, making it far from a pleasant experience.","Everything turned out to be unexpected when using the home security system.

I had expected a seamless and user-friendly installation process, but instead, I encountered complexities and confusion that were unexpected. The lack of clear instructions and the technical challenges during setup were far from what I had anticipated.

The system's unreliable performance and frequent connectivity issues were also unexpected. I had hoped for consistent surveillance, accurate motion detection, and reliable remote monitoring, but instead, I experienced intermittent video feeds, missed recordings, and false alarms. These unexpected issues undermined the system's effectiveness and left me questioning its reliability.

Additionally, the technical glitches with the mobile app were unexpected. I had expected a smooth and responsive interface, but instead, I encountered crashes, unresponsiveness, and an inability to access the system remotely. These unexpected technical difficulties further hampered my overall experience with the product.

NIRA Home use laser,400,Disappointment,,,"I am not coping well with the fact that age is starting to take a toll on my looks, especially facial wrinkles and loss of volume.  The NIRA Home use laser is a small, approved device to help rebuild some of the collagen under the skin that depletes with age.  I was so excited to receive a discount code of 50% off right after Thanksgiving and ordered the device.  I had to wait 2 months for the product to be shipped.  I felt that for what it cost, the wait to receive it was overly long.

There were also many reports of people who stated the product was too powerful and painful when used around the eyes, which was where I was intending to use it.  So I was pleasantly surprised when there was no pain at all, only a slight warming sensation.","Yes because overall I don't feel my age, I usually feel about 15-20 years younger both mentally and in other physical attributes (I am petite in stature and slightly underweight).  So it is very important to me to try to look my best, especially in my face which, of course, everyone sees all the time.  I want to continue to have my 'exterior' reflect how I feel on my 'interior' if that makes sense.","Yes because while most women will visit a plastic surgeon or cosmetic dermatologist to have very similar procedures done professionally, the cost of those treatments/procedures is extremely high (in the thousands of dollars) and is something that has to be done often (every 6 to 12 months).  There is also some 'down time' where they have to take a couple days off work for the skin to heal.  Also, if the professional makes a mistake, the damage can be unrepairable.  So lots of risk.

clothing (a dress),$280 ,Pride,,,"I bought the dress using the first disposable income I'd ever had in my adult life. I bought it from a store I'd never been able to shop at before, after having lost some weight (Free People). The cut of the dress was inspired, with a slight empire waist and an elaborated threaded design along the breast of the top. It was impossible for me to ignore the quality of the fabric itself, being far and above anything else I owned. The color matched my eyes, and it had both a casual air about it and this flattering classy element, that I just hadn't experienced before. I could just as easily wear it to the beach as to a fancy brunch or a night out. The combination of all those things made me feel prideful as soon as I carried it out the store and for months after purchasing.","I knew that not only had I worked hard at my job to save and earn enough to finally spend some money on my clothes outside of some fast fashion outlet but also that I had lost a significant amount of weight prior to purchasing, so it was like I was crowning this personal achievement in a private moment. Wearing it out, I'd be the only person aware of this association but I imagine in hindsight that probably lent itself to how well I wore it. I was immensely proud of that dress.

I'd heard a lot about the observation deck at Willis Tower and, being a new resident to Chicago at the time, it seemed like a fun excursion for the family. It was completely disappointing.

It was so crowded by the time my family and I were able to nab a spot on the ""deck"" overhang, we had less than 3 minutes before the eager faces of the lines of other families were already shuffling us off.

Disappointing is the word, definitely.","When doing tourist-y things you expect to deal with other tourists but the reward was so small, the energy and price so high, it was an incredibly irritating, annoying experience.

Like, way too crowded. It sucked. ","Yes because it was shared family time. My family always kinda struggles to have a good time on vacation, either due to cost or mutual, inevitable frustration. I wanted to contribute to a good time and instead I ended up wasting 3 hours and almost $400 waiting in line not really talking to one another. I wanted it to be a happy memory and it's not like it was the worst experience I've ever had but instead it was like another snapshot of mild embarrassment and moderate disappointment in a family photo album full of bummers. ","No because it was/is absolutely a tourist trap. Like, a real tourist trap. Something you could easily skip. I'd rather ride the elevator up and down all those floors for a half hour than hang around trying to get a good view on the observation deck. Boring as hell.

Perhaps it had advanced features like a steam function or a temperature control setting, making ironing my clothes much easier and more efficient.

Another reason i felt disappointed about my purchase is the sense of regret that comes from investing in something that does not live up to my expectations.

Overall, it was a valuable and memorable experience that enriched my life.","Yes, because the trip to Hawaii was consistent with what I wanted.

The trip aligned with my desires and expectations because I was seeking a destination with beautiful natural landscapes, and Hawaii delivered just that. The stunning beaches, lush forests, and volcanic formations exceeded my expectations and fulfilled my desire for picturesque scenery. I also wanted a mix of relaxation and adventure, and Hawaii provided the perfect balance. I had the opportunity to unwind on the beaches, indulge in spa treatments, and enjoy peaceful moments, while also engaging in thrilling activities like surfing, snorkeling, and exploring the outdoors. The vibrant local culture and cuisine were additional elements I sought, and I was able to immerse myself in Hawaiian traditions, try delicious food, and interact with friendly locals.

Exploring the vibrant local culture, trying delicious Hawaiian cuisine, and taking in the relaxed and peaceful atmosphere further contributed to the overall pleasantness of the trip.","During the trip, some things turned out just like I expected, while others caught me off guard.

The natural beauty of Hawaii, like the amazing beaches and lush forests, was exactly what I had imagined. I had seen all those stunning pictures online, so I knew it was going to be beautiful, and it totally lived up to the hype.

The locals being friendly was also as I expected. People had told me about the Aloha spirit and how welcoming Hawaiians are, so I wasn't surprised when I met so many friendly and nice folks.

But there were a few unexpected things too. The sheer magnitude of the natural beauty was mind-blowing. No picture or video could capture the real beauty of those landscapes. Being there in person was a whole new level of awe.

And let's talk about the food! I had heard the food in Hawaii was good, but man, it blew me away. The flavors and combinations were so unique and delicious. Trying dishes like poke bowls and shave ice was a tasty surprise.

All in all, the trip had its expected moments and some pleasant surprises, making it even more memorable.",4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,1,4,1,4,7,4,1,1,7,4,1,4,7,7,1,7,1,1,4,7,1,1,7,NA,,Dining at an expensive restaurant.,200,Disappointment,,,"My experience at that expensive restaurant was quite disappointing. While the initial impression was positive, the overall service quickly became lackluster and inattentive. It took a long time to place our order, and when the food finally arrived, it was lukewarm and underwhelming. The flavors lacked depth, the presentation was average, and the portion sizes were surprisingly small. Considering the high prices, I expected a more memorable culinary experience. Unfortunately, the restaurant fell short of my expectations and I left feeling unsatisfied both in terms of taste and value. If you're looking for an exceptional dining experience, I would recommend exploring other options that offer better quality and value for your money.","
I felt disappointed for several reasons. Firstly, the service was not up to par. Despite the initial friendly greeting, the staff seemed disinterested and inattentive throughout the evening. Slow response times and a lack of attentiveness made the dining experience less enjoyable.

Secondly, the food itself did not meet my expectations. Given the reputation and prices of the restaurant, I anticipated a higher level of culinary excellence. However, the flavors were lacking in depth and the presentation was underwhelming. It felt like the dishes lacked creativity and the quality fell short of what I had hoped for.

Furthermore, the portion sizes were surprisingly small. Considering the prices charged at this expensive restaurant, I expected more generous portions. Leaving the restaurant feeling hungry and unsatisfied added to my disappointment.

Lastly, the overall value for money was lacking. The high prices on the menu did not align with the quality of the food and dining experience. I felt like I was paying a premium simply for the restaurant's reputation, rather than receiving a truly exceptional and memorable dining experience.

In summary, the combination of subpar service, underwhelming food, small portions, and the feeling of not getting good value for the price led to my disappointment with the restaurant.




","Yes, the dinner was important to me because of the cost and effort involved. I had heard great things about this expensive restaurant and decided to treat myself to a special dining experience, making a reservation well in advance. The high prices on the menu signified a significant financial investment, and I saw it as an opportunity to indulge in exceptional cuisine.","No because the dinner was not consistent with what I wanted. I had expected a memorable and exceptional dining experience, given the reputation and prices of the restaurant. However, the service was lacking, the food fell short in terms of flavor and presentation, and the portion sizes were small. The overall experience did not align with my expectations for a high-end dining experience, leading to disappointment.","No, it was not a pleasant experience. Despite the initial positive impressions, the overall dining experience was far from enjoyable. The lackluster service, including slow response times and a general sense of indifference from the staff, created an atmosphere of disappointment. Additionally, the food itself did not live up to expectations, with flavors that lacked depth and presentation that was underwhelming. The small portion sizes left me feeling unsatisfied, and the high prices further intensified the disappointment. Overall, the combination of subpar service, underwhelming food, and the feeling of not getting value for the price made the experience far from pleasant.","No, everything did not turn out as expected.

Vacation - Cabin rental ,$900 ,Disappointment,,,"I rented a cabin just recently, about two weeks ago actually. When I arrived with my S.O. it wasn't exactly as pictured on their website. The scenic view of the lake was exactly like the pictures. However, the cabin we were staying at looked about 10-20 years older than the pictures. The basketball hoop in the driveway was rusted and decayed, and the forest scenery behind the cabin had a bunch of old trucks, and boats just rotting away in the background. There was also an old condemned house just below our cabin and another condemned house further out behind our cabin. 

It was disturbing like some ""Cabin in the Woods/Hills have eyes"" shit. We also couldn't park our car in the garage. The garage door was locked from the inside, and there were black garbage bags over the windows, which made it seem even creepier. The cabin inside looked like someone's grandmother's house.

From the moment i laid eyes on the phone, doubts began to surface. Its design was clunky and outdated, reminiscent of a relic from a bygone era. But appearances were not the only downfall of the phone Its functionality left much to be desired. The device promised seamless communication, but it often struggled to maintain a stable connection. To make matters worse, the device was plagued by a host of technical issues. Its battery life was abysmal, leaving users scrambling for a power source within a matter of hours. The operating system was riddled with glitches and crashes, causing endless frustration and lost data. it lacked compatibility with popular applications and services, isolating its me from the wider digital world. i had to go back to the shop the next day to complain to them so the issues could be addressed ",because i know what i passed through to save up the money i used to buy and have always dreamed of buying and using the phone now it has not even been hours and am experiencing break down and regrets ,yes because the current phone i was using was bad so i seriously needed a new phone as soon as possible which i took time to save up for,No because the product i bought was faulty and bad so i had to go back to the shop for them to give me a new one or refund ,No because they gave me a faulty phone so it was not a pleasant experience ,unexpected because the product i was given was in bad shape so everything did not turn out as i expected ,4,1,1,1,1,7,7,1,7,5,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,1,1,7,7,1,NA,,Michael kores wrist watch,500,Joy,,,"

Computer Parts,800,Pride,,,I had never installed my own computer components before and had always just bought pre-made computers. This time I bought the computer parts separately and went through the trial of taking out my old parts and installing the new ones. Although there was great difficulty in the installation process for a few reasons I was ultimately successful. My computer had underwent a massive upgrade and I proved to myself that I was capable of this undertaking which is why I felt a measure of pride every time I booted up that computer from then onward.,"I had proven myself capable of computer repair, maintenance and upkeep, and had overcome my own inexperience and several other technical errors during the installation process.","Yes because my computer is my main source of entertainment, socialization, and the place I get my work done. My computer can't work without its inner workings and at the time it was in dire need of an upgrade. The parts themselves were the physical embodiment of that upgrade and my ability to keep using my computer in all the ways that I want to so they had a good degree of importance.",No because while the end result I wanted ultimately ended up being achieved the installation process proved far harder than I thought it would be due to defects with the parts I had ordered. It took me hours to realize it was the parts causing the computer issues rather than my lack of ability which made for a miserable experience. Once the parts were replaced I was able to install them with little issue which is what I wanted form the start.,I lean towards yes that it was a pleasant experience as the parts lasted for years compared to the day or two of trouble I had with their installation. The non-defective parts worked perfectly and kept my computer top of the line for a few years longer.,Unexpected due to the difficulty of installation because I did not know the first batch of parts I had bought were defective. This made it so they wouldn't work while installed correctly. However once it was discovered that this was the error things became much easier as I had them replaced and the situation played out like I had wanted all along with the parts being relatively easy to install and their everyday use being everything I wanted and expected.,5,6,4,2,3,5,7,7,6,5,6,5,2,7,2,7,7,4,1,5,6,4,7,6,7,4,4,7,4,1,1,5,Confusion,6,VR Headset,600,Disappointment,,,"The VR headset I purchased was sort of the opposite of my previous experience in that it was very easy to use and setup but it didn't really match my expectation and there were unexpected difficulties that made me not want to use it. The key emotion I felt was disappointment and that was mainly due to the fact that I had no idea just how badly and how quickly VR gaming would make me feel motion sick.

The first game that I played that allowed the player to move freely messed me up so badly that I was only able to play for a few minutes before having to take the headset off and lie down for a few HOURS. I forced myself to try a few times more but it just felt like I couldn't get used to it and ended up having to medicate with myself with dramamine just to be able to play the game for extended periods. I really liked the idea of VR games but I just wasn't and am still not willing to take medication just to be able to play video games without intense sickness.",The device made me sick to use. While motion sickness was the main concern I also found that the screens within the headset sort of hurt my eyes due to their low quality and gave eyestrain pretty quickly. It was supremely disappointing that a device meant for fun had so many different ways to make me sick and miserable.,Yes because it was a rather expensive purchase and this was when VR was getting really popular and all my friends were getting into it. They too reported some difficulties in adjustment but they all got over it in a day or two while I seemingly was never able to. I forced myself to play through mounting sickness just to get some enjoyment from the device and to play some games with them.,No because the device made me sick to use it and I was never able to get over it. I was expecting some degree of difficulty in adjusting at first but I absolutely wasn't expecting to still be floored with intense motion sickness within a few minutes even after few weeks or months of use.,"No because of the aforementioned sickness. The games I bought for the device were fun to play but I could not derive enjoyment of them for any real length of time due to the nausea, headaches, and eyestrain that playing them brought me.","Unexpected because I was not able to overcome the sickness associated with using VR for the first time. As I mentioned already I fully expected some minor difficulties adjusting, but I wasn't expecting such intense sickness or being unable to overcome it even after repeated exposure.

Philips Hues Lights,$120 ,Regret,,,"I initially felt excitement as I received the package.

I filled my head with fantasy about how it would elevate the room and the experience. The negative emotion hit once I actually received the product and tried to set it up. It was a long and arduous process, filled with frustration. Worst of all, once it was finally set up properly, the actual effect was not what was shown on the website -- it did not live up to the expectations.

So I enrolled her in this training and boarding facility while I was on my trip.

As my lefft foot feel asleep, the stewardess came around with dinner which was a mess of something like a noodle and a tiny bit of too fat chicken. I knew it was extra greasy because the fat guy sitting next to me in aisle seat, dropped some onto my leg.  

After dinner I wanted to sleep but the others in my row wanted to watch a movie with their headphones so loud I couldn't hope to get some shuteye.

No problem, I thought. I have a layover in Korea where I know there is a nap zone for weary travelers. Unfortunetly this room was backed and I had to spend the whole time at the airport wandering around and talking to a robot that didn't seem too friendly.

Computer,"1,500",Other positive emotion,Excited,,"I was very excited to get the computer going. For me it was a blank slate with an operating system and then all my programs to install. I could not wait to get started and install only the things I needed to ensure it was running at maximum effectiveness with no resources wasted. After installing the OS and the games and programs I regularly use I got to work trying them out to see how the new computer performed.

I was not disappointed in the least as I received the massive performance gains in the applications I had hoped to receive them in. They exceeded honestly even my most optimistic expectations and truly made using the applications feel like a new experience because of how smoothly they ran. I have had the computer for about two months now, but every time I turn it on I am excited to enjoy the newfound performance of the computer when compared to my last one.","I was just excited because of how well it worked and ran the games and applications I needed it to.

Gaining this performance increase is something that I will be experiencing more waking hours than not and it is an integral part of my life, let alone my daily routine.","Yes the computer was everything I wanted and more because of how well it exceeded my expectations. I honestly had hoped for a 20% increase in performance in a specific game, but I received a 50-60% performance.

All in all it has just exceeded what I wanted in virtually every way imaginable. ","No, initially it was not a pleasant experience because I had setup the computer and initially it would not boot up to the OS. It was stuck. I had to spend a couple dozen hours troubleshooting to ultimately fix the issue. This was obviously a lot of work and very strenuous and difficult as I had tried everything I could think of many times and had to consult a lot of people for more ideas.

Recently my husband and I stayed at a 5 star hotel in a resort town in the mountains.,1200,Disappointment,,,"We are a working class couple and have never really splurged on ourselves. It was our 30th anniversary so we decided to treat ourselves to a little vacation at what is supposed to be a luxury hotel. We had to save up for this trip, sacrificing and working extra hours to afford it. We even splurged on a nicer room. When we arrived the front desk treated us horribly. They ignored us, taking others who were behind us first. Then they claimed we didn't have a reservation despite us producing a confirmation number. They then said we couldn't have the room we reserved and paid for. When we did finally get into a room, which looked out to a brick wall we found that it hadn't been cleaned yet. Our toilet was also leaking and the air didn't work. We called the desk and they rudely said they would get someone up when they could. I finally had enough and while I'm not the kind of person to do this I went down to the desk and asked to speak to a manager. The desk clerk rolled his eyes, threw his pen down and said ""whatever Karen"" under his breath. He did go get the manager and I told her everything that had happened.

Unfortunately, my experience with these shoes has been nothing short of disappointing. First and foremost, the comfort level of these shoes was severely lacking.

The lack of sufficient padding and arch support left my feet feeling fatigued and achy. I had hoped for a shoe that would provide the necessary comfort to keep me motivated and focused during my exercise routine, but these shoes fell far short in that aspect.  Moreover, the durability of GYM Shoe NIKE was a major letdown. Within a short period of use, I noticed signs of wear and tear. The materials used in the construction seemed flimsy and prone to damage. The soles wore down quickly, compromising the grip and stability of the shoe. I expected a pair of gym shoes to withstand the rigors of regular workouts, but unfortunately, these shoes did not meet even the basic standards of durability. Another issue I encountered with these shoes was their lack of breathability. During intense exercise sessions, my feet would become excessively sweaty, leading to discomfort and an unpleasant odor. The inadequate ventilation in the shoe design exacerbated this problem, and it was disheartening to have to deal with such discomfort while trying to focus on my workouts.  my experience with GYM Shoe NIKE  has been unsatisfactory.
