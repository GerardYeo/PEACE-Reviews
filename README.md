# The Perception and Experience of Appraisals and Consumption Emotions in Reviews (PEACE-Reviews) Dataset

The PEACE-Reviews Dataset is a unique compilation of annotated autobiographical accounts where individuals detail their emotional and appraisal experiences during interactions with personally significant products or services. Focusing on the inherent variability in consumer experiences, this dataset offers an in-depth analysis of participants' psychological traits, their evaluative feedback on purchases, and the resultant emotions. Notably, the PEACE-Reviews dataset encompasses emotion, cognition, individual traits, and demographic data.

Please refer to the datasheet ('PEACE-Review datasheet.docx') that contains all the information about the variables in the dataset. The datasheet also provides some statistics about the label distributions of appraisals.
